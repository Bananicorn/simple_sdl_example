#A basic example for a SDL program in C

All this example does is open a window and blit a bitmap to the screen, the code is taken directly from the SDL2 documentation

to set it up, ensure you have SDL, GCC and MinGW installed.
Make sure you also have the right DLLs and header/library files for Windows
get them at https://libsdl.org/ (get the SDL2 mingw-devel files).
the header files (.h) are placed locally under SDL/include/
the .dll files, .a and .la files are placed under SDL/lib/
Lastly, the SDL2.dll to be shipped with the windows exe needs to be placed in the same folder as the executable.

Keep in mind, this is just a *very* simple example, without proper project structure and a very minimal Makefile.

The directory Structure when you're done should look as follows (you can check with the `tree` command on unix systems):
├── Makefile
├── hello.bmp
├── main.c
├── SDL2.dll
├── SDL
│   ├── include
│   │   ├── all_files_ending_in.h
│   └── lib
│       ├── all_files_ending_in.dll
│       └── all_files_ending_in.la
